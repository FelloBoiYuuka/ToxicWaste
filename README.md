Just another malware database.
You know the deal, don't download this stuff unless you know what you're doing.
Passwords for the archives are "infected"
For those who are going to add files to this, make sure it is a .7z file and with the password "infected". Oh, and if a file is too big, make sure to make it a .tar file and then .7z it with the password. Thx!
